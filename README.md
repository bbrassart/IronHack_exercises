WELCOME TO MY IRONHACK EXERCISES REPO
=====================================

In this repo, you will find some of the most interesting exercises I did during the IronHack web development bootcamp I attended during summer '14.
I sorted them by programming language.
Every exercise has its own folder, with a README file filled with instructions and a 'lib' folder.
Feel free to contact me if needed.
