========

FizzBuzz solution using a lambda function

Ruby Version: 2.2.2

To run it, do :
- Clone the repo or copy the files
- You can run the tests by typing 'rspec tests_main.rb' when you're in the 'lib'
- To run it, execute the 'main.rb' script or build it in your favourite text editor


Description
===========

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". You can also make it harder by adding new conditions.
