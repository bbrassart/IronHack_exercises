DESCRIPTION
======================

We are creating a awesome ASCII chart for comparing ratings of movies in IMDB.
We will be using IMDB Gem.
The expected output should be a table. For every movie, there should be a vertical line of stars representing the rating, followed by the index number of the movie.

We will specify the movies in an external file called movies.txt. We should search IMDB for the title in the text file and accept the first result as correct.

Die Hard
The Godfather
Home alone
Star trek, the new generation
The night of the living dead
Titanic

The program must make a search in IMDB and show the same number of sharp signs as the rating of the movie rounded to the closest number.
